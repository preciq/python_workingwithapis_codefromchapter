Most APIs impose a rate limit (a limit to how many times an API may be called in a given amount of time)

To see this for github, go to: 
https://api.github.com/rate_limit

should see a response like this: 


{
    "resources": {
    --snip--
    1 "search": {
    2 "limit": 10,
    3 "remaining": 9,
    4 "reset": 1652338832,
    "used": 1,
    "resource": "search"
       },
    }
}
